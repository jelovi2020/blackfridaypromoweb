                                <span>The operation of <strong>BlackFridayPromoWeb</strong> is very simple.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
                                <span>To participate you only have to fill out a minimum form whose only mandatory information is a name, nickname, etc. with which we can contact you and that you want to show in your promotion.</span>
								<span><strong>Please</strong>, choose appropriately this name that you want to display because you will not be able to modify it in following accesses.</span>
                            </p>	
							<p> 
                                <span>Rest of fields are optional but, logically, we recommend filling them in since your promotion will be reflected in them:</span>
							</p>
							<p> 
                                <span><strong>An image</strong>: URL of the image you want. It can be your company logo, an image showing one or more promotions that you want to offer, your personal stamp, etc.</span>
								<span>You can modify this image URL in subsequent accesses, if you wish.</span>
							</p>
							<p> 
                                <span><strong>A link</strong>: URL of the website you want. It can be the website of your business, link to your personal blog, etc./span>
								<span>You can modify this link in subsequent accesses, if you wish.</span>
							</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                <span>The first time you participate you will get the corresponding points and, in addition, you will be assigned with a <strong>numeric identifier</strong>.</span>
								<span>It is very important that you write down this numerical identifier, since it will be your only necessary access data on following occasions.</span>
								<span>On this numerical identifier, the points will be accumulated each time you participate.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
                                <span>Once you have this numerical identifier, you will not need any more information to access the web and continue to accumulate points on this unique and personal identifier of yours.</span>
                            </p>																				
							<p>
                                <span>You can also choose if you want to participate as a company or in a personal capacity. If you want to participate in both categories, you will get a different identifier for each case.</span>
                            </p>																											
							<p>
                                <span>Finally, in order to participate in each access we request you to make a symbolic deposit with the amount you want (minimum € 1) and that will serve to multiply your points for each access.</span>
								<span>You have different <strong>secure payment options</strong> through PayPal (card, PayPal account, etc).</span>
                            </p>	
							<p>
                                <span>You are able to participate as many times as you want. The points obtained will be accumulated based on your Black Friday Promo web identifier.</span>
                            </p>	
							<p>
                                <span>You can also participate in both categories (personal and company) with a different name.</span>
								<span>For example, you can promote your business by getting points in the business category, while you promote your personal blog in the personal category.</span>
                            </p>								
                        </div>

                        <div>
                            <p> 
								<span>Each access will earn as many points as there are days left to date Black Friday 2021, considering that each remaining month will be considered 30 days. All these points, multiplied by the payment you have made each time.</span>                               
                                <span>The sooner you make your accesses and the higher your payment is, <strong>the more points you will obtain.</strong></span>
							</p>
							<p>
                                <span>For example, if you make a deposit on 2021/01/20, you will be awarded 4.650 points, corresponding to:</span>
                            </p>	
							<p>
                                <span>   1 point for each of the 310 days remaining until 2021/11/26 (date of Black Friday 2021).</span>
                            </p>
							<p>
                                <span>   All these points, multiplied by the payment you have made in this access.</span>
                            </p>
							<p>
                                <span>   If, for example, in this access you have made a deposit of € 15, the total of your points this time will be: € 15 x 310 = 4.650 points</span>
                            </p>		
							<p>
                                <span>You can check your current position by entering your numeric identifier in "Your position" section of this website.</span>

							</p>
							<p>
                                <span>On 2021/11/01 the winner of each category (personal and company) will be published in a specific section of this website.</span>
